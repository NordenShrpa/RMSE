Design Notes 
The Norden Real Estate RSMS website boasts a clean, modern design that skillfully balances 
visual appeal with functionality. The layout is responsive, optimized for various devices to 
ensure a seamless user experience across platforms. The intuitive navigation features a 
prominent header with the "Norden Real Estate" logo, an easily accessible menu, and 
strategically placed call-to-action buttons for "Sign In" and "Add Listing". The hero section 
immediately captures attention with a large, high-quality background image of a residential 
property, complemented by a bold headline inviting users to "Find Your dream house". A 
prominent search bar with dropdown options for property type and location takes center stage, 
facilitating quick and easy property searches. Below, the "What We Do" section efficiently 
communicates the company's core services through four iconographic representations: Selling 
Service, Rental Service, Property Listing, and Legal Investment. The recent property listings are 
presented in an attractive grid layout, each featuring a high-quality image, a "For Sale" tag, 
essential property details, pricing, and location information. The design concludes with a "Why 
Choose Us" section, reinforcing the company's value proposition alongside a relevant image, 
effectively building trust with potential clients. 
Colors and Fonts 
The color palette of the Norden Real Estate website has been carefully selected to convey 
professionalism and trustworthiness while maintaining visual appeal. A rich dark blue (navy) 
serves as the primary color, used for the header background, and select text elements, creating a 
sense of stability and reliability. This is balanced by the liberal use of white for the main 
background and some text, ensuring a clean, fresh look that enhances readability. Teal or 
turquoise accents are employed for buttons and highlights, injecting energy, and guiding user 
attention to key interactive elements. Light gray is utilized for some background elements and 
secondary text, providing subtle contrast and depth to the overall design. The typography 
combines two complementary font families to significant effect. The sans-serif font Muli is the 
workhorse of the site, used for body text and some headings in various weights (400, 400i, 500, 
600, 700) to create clear visual hierarchy and emphasis where needed. The slightly playful 
rounded sans-serif font Comforted (in weights 400 and 700) is employed for the logo and some 
headings, adding a touch of approachability and modernity to the otherwise professional design. 
This thoughtful combination of colors and fonts results in a visually cohesive, legible, and 
engaging user interface that aligns perfectly with the expectations of a high-end real estate 
platform.


Conclusion 
The Norden Real Estate RSMS website presents a well-designed, user-friendly platform that 
effectively serves its purpose in the real estate market. Its clean layout, intuitive navigation, and 
focus on visual appeal create a professional and trustworthy impression. The site successfully 
balances functionality with aesthetics, providing an efficient tool for property listing and 
searching while offering an enjoyable user experience for all stakeholders in the real estate 
process.
